# First demographic transition Visualization
This project visualizes the First Demographic Transition in selected European countries (Austria, England, France, Sweden) by plotting crude birth and death rates (per 1,000 population) over time.

The first demographic transition is a theoretical concept describing the shift from high
to low fertility and mortality levels, accompanied by natural population increase.
Fertility and mortality levels are typically measured using birth and death rates,
calculated as the number of births and deaths per 1,000 population annually.

The graph illustrates country differences in population dynamics, the pace of fertility
and mortality changes, and their relationship to major historical events. For inquisitive
students, this visualization can serve as a starting point for exploring the connections
between demographic indicators and historical socio-economic circumstances,
emphasizing the importance of country-specific case studies and consideration of
regional particularities when applying general theoretical concepts.

France, for instance, experienced a nearly simultaneous decrease in fertility and
mortality, leading to depopulation concerns and the implementation of Europe's first
pronatalist policy. In contrast, England faced a comparatively large population
increase during the 19th century, contributing to colonization efforts to expand
territories and secure resources. Sweden, as a welfare state providing family support,
never experienced significant population decline. Austria encountered several military
conflicts and epidemics in the mid-19th century, resulting in substantial population
decrease, and was significantly impacted by World War I.
